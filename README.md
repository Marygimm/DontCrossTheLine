# DontCrossTheLine
Small experiment with UIKit and MapKit using overlays and tracking location (still needs improvement)

Show Alert with app in foreground if user try to scape more than 50 meters, changing image and title.
Show Notification if app in Background and user try to scape.

If user has no permissions for location nothing will happen, so you need to give permissions and app will be updated.
